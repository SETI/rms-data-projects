  DESCRIPTION                   = "This index describes the surface intercept
    geometry for the planet, regular satellites and other targeted bodies
    within the field of view of Galileo SSI images. For each image, the file
    contains one row for each body predicted to fall at least partially within
    the image. Starting with the Jupiter tour in volume GO_0017, a row for
    Jupiter is included regardless of whether it fall inside the image.

    Occasionally, SPICE pointing information is unavailable for the time at
    which an image was exposed. When this situation occurs, no row has been
    added to the file.

    Most of this geometry information has been constructed by uniformly
    sampling the pixels that comprise each image. Pixels have been sampled on
    an 8x8 grid, i.e., every 64th pixel. To accommodate pointing uncertainty,
    the image boundary was expanded on every side by a distance equivalent to
    25 narrow-angle pixels.

    For each sampled pixel, a variety of geometric quantitities have been
    calculated, and the minimum and maximum values of each quantity have been
    tabulated. Note that, for angular quantities that cycle from 360 degrees
    to zero, the tabulated minimum can be numerically greater than the
    maximum.

    Regions of a body that are obscured by the planet or by a targeted moon
    are excluded from the tabulation. The dark side of each body is also
    excluded. If a body is too small to have been captured in an 8x8 sampling
    of the image, then the associated NULL_CONSTANT will appear in each
    column."

    DESCRIPTION                 = "Phase angle at the center of the planet or
      specified target body. This is the angle between the local direction
      of in incoming photon from the Sun and the local direction of an
      outgoing photon to the observer.

      This value is defined by the instantaneous geometry at the time of the
      observation; it is independent of the field of view.

      This column tabulates the minimum value of center phase angle
      among all of the pixels observed in that direction."
