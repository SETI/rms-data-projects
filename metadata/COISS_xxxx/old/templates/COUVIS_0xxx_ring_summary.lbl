  DESCRIPTION                   = "This index describes the ring intercept
    geometry of the field of view of Cassini UVIS observations. The table
    generally contains one row for each data file found on the volume
    identified by the VOLUME_ID keyword above.

    Occasionally, SPICE pointing information is unavailable for the time at
    which an observation was taken. When this situation occurs, no row has
    been added to the file.

    This geometry information has been constructed by sampling every UVIS
    spatial pixel in the associated data file. For each sampled pixel, a
    variety of geometric quantitities have been calculated, and the minimum
    and maximum values of each quantity have been tabulated. Note that, for
    angular quantities that cycle from 360 degrees to zero, the tabulated
    minimum can be numerically greater than the maximum. If the ring plane
    does not fall within the field of view, values of the NULL_CONSTANT appear
    in the table.

    Regions of the ring plane that are obscured by Saturn or by a targeted
    moon are excluded from the tabulation."
