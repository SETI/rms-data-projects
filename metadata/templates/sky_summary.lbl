# Geometry file template for bodies.  
#
#  This template controls the creation of body geometry files.  The procedure 
#  for generating geometry files for a host is as follows.  Files referred to 
#  below should be copied into the top directory for the collection, e.g., 
#  GO_0xxx:
#
#  2. Copy and edit the <collection>_geometry.py script to reflect the 
#     type of index and glob pattern for the table files.
#  3. Copy and edit config.py to address any host-dependent processing.
#  4. Run <collection>_geometry.py from the collection top directory.
#
#  In the host_defs files, replace all values describing the new host.  
#  In this template, quantities enclosed in dollar signs are automatically 
#  filled in and should not be edited.  Add a column for each quantity to be 
#  copied from the product label into the index.

    geometry of the field of view of the instrument. The table contains
    one row for each image file found on the volume identified by the
    VOLUME_ID keyword above.

    Occasionally, SPICE pointing information is unavailable for the time at
    which an image was exposed. When this situation occurs, no row has been
    added to the file.

    This geometry information has been constructed by uniformly sampling the
    pixels that comprise each image. Pixels have been sampled on an 8x8 grid,
    i.e., every 64th pixel. To accommodate pointing uncertainty, the image
    boundary was expanded on every side by a distance equivalent to 25
    narrow-angle pixels."
